# Face_mask_detection

It is built using python libraries like Keras, OpenCV, Sklearn and Neural Network. It consists of two pairs of Conv and MaxPool layers to extract features from the dataset. Which is then followed by a Flatten and Dropout layer to convert the data in 1D and ensure overfitting.
And to train the machine i have used a dataset which is available on the internet.
